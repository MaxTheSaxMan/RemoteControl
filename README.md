Use of a TV remote control with an Arduino
Simple code for using a TV remote control with an Arduino. These examples relate to an article in the MERG journal describing how to use a simple infrared receiver and TV remote control with an Arduino to control devices on a model railway layout. The sketches are:
Get_Codes: To discover the codes transmitted by the remote control buttons 
Use_Codes_1: To test the codes with simple print statements 
Use_Codes_2: Different ways to control LEDs
